### Introduction to solving biological problems with Python

- **Description**: This course provides a practical introduction to the writing of Python programs for the complete novice. Participants are lead through the core aspects of Python illustrated by a series of example programs. Upon completion of the course, attentive participants will be able to write simple Python programs and customise more complex code to fit their needs.
- **Materials**: [python-basic](https://github.com/pajtraining/python-basic) course repository contains the Jupyter notebook and example data files as well as scripts for this course.
- **Objectives**:
  - Edit and run Python code
  - Write file-processing python programs that produce output to the terminal and/or external files
  - Create stand-alone python programs to process biological data
  - Know how to develop your skills in Python after the course
  - During this course you will learn about:
    - Core concepts about Python syntax: data types, variables, blocks and indentation, writing code in file
    - Different ways to control program flow using loops and conditional tests
    - Reading from and writing to files
- **Schedule**:
  - [Day 1 - Introduction: objectives and course schedule](https://github.com/pajtraining/python-basic/blob/master/python_basic_1_intro.ipynb)
  - [Day 2 - Introduction: objectives and course schedule](https://github.com/pajtraining/python-basic/blob/master/python_basic_2_intro.ipynb)
- **Installation instruction**: [setup steps](python-basic-setup.md)

### Data science in Python

- **Description**: This course covers *concepts and strategies for working more effectively with Python* with the aim of writing reusable code. We will be using Python libraries to explore data in files, creating functions and modules to write reusable code, manipulating data using Pandas, visualising data with Matplotlib and working with biological data using BioPython.
- **Materials**: [python-data-science](https://github.com/pajtraining/python-data-science) course repository contains the Jupyter notebook and example data files as well as scripts for this course.
- **Objectives**:
  - Writing **reusable** code, using **functions** and **libraries**
  - Acquiring a working knowledge of **key concepts** which are prerequisites for advanced programming in Python like writing classes to build objects
  - During this course you will learn about:
    - Using Python libraries to explore data in files
    - Creating functions and modules to write reusable code
    - Manipulating data using Pandas
    - Visualising data with Matplotlib
    - Working with biological data using BioPython
- **Schedule**:
  - [Day 1 - Aims, objectives and course schedule](https://github.com/pajtraining/python-data-science/blob/master/10_python_data_intro.ipynb)
  - [Day 2 - Aims, objectives and course schedule](https://github.com/pajtraining/python-data-science/blob/master/20_python_data_intro.ipynb)
